1. What is a closure?

Answer :
    Closure is when a function is able to remember and access
    its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.

    lets understand it by this example below :

    function foo() {
	     var a = 2;

      function bar() {
    		console.log( a );
    	}

    	return bar;
    }

    var baz = foo();

    baz(); // 2

    On executing baz(), it returns output 2 because bar() still has a refernce to the scope in
    which it was defined, and that refernce is closed closure.

2. What is lexical scope?

Answer :
    lexical scope is scope that is defined at lexing(Compile time, Look to question#11 for more) time.
    In other words, lexical scope is based on where variables and blocks of scope are authored,
    by you, at write time, and thus is (mostly) set in stone by the time the lexer processes your code.
